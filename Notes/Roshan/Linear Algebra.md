A vector is an object that has both magnitude and direction. In linear algebra, the tail of the vector is always placed on the origin.  The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers that gives instructions for how to get from the tail of that vector to its tip. 

Scaling: The process of stretching or sometimes reversing the direction of a vector is called scaling.

Scaling two vectors and adding them together is called a linear combination of those two vectors.

When the vectors multiplied by their scalars can be added, the vectors are linearly independent.

The span of two or more  vectors is the set of all their linear combinations .

Rank of a matrix means the number of dimensions in the output of the transformation.
If the rank equals the number of columns in the matrix then it is called as full rank.
The columns of the matrix tell us where the basic vectors land and the span of those
transformed basis vectors gives us all the possible outputs.

Dot product of matrices:
v•w >0 if vectors are in the same direction.
v•w = 0 if vectors are perpendicular to each other.
v•w <0 if vectors are in the opposite direction.
Cross product:
Cross product will be the area of the parallelogram formed between the two vectors.
The cross product will be +ve if the vector v is to the right of w.
The cross product will be -ve if the vector v is to the left of w.

A single eigenvalue can have more than a line full of eigenvectors.
