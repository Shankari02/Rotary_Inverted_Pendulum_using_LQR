- This folder contains the multiple MATLAB simulations done for getting well-verse with the MATLAB software.
  The simulations include simple pendulum, spring-mass system and complex-pulley system in both ideal state as well as stabilised using LQR controller.

- The images of the various animations are represented below:

- The folder also contains a derivation pdf where in all the Langrangian equations for the respective systems have been derived.
